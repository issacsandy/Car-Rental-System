# Car-Rental-System
This Java code implements a Car Rental System.
# OverView
The Car Rental System is a Java-based application that allows users to rent and return cars. It simulates a real-world car rental service with functionalities like checking car availability, renting cars for a specified duration, and calculating rental costs. This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and interaction through a simple command-line interface.
 ## Features

- Register new customers when they rent a car.
- Rent available cars and calculate total rental costs based on the number of days.
- Return rented cars and update the system to mark them as available.
- Display available cars for rent.
- Dynamic car and customer management using `ArrayList`.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java
- **OOP Concepts:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- **Data Structures:** `ArrayList` for storing cars, customers, and rental data.
